PROJECTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

LX5 AEGIS
---------
Linux File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) agent written in Rust.
Creates cryptographic baselines of critical system files and
alerts on unauthorized changes in real time.
Designed to run as a systemd service.

WRITING
-------
Building a File Integrity Monitor (FIM) in Rust

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a foundational defensive
security control, but it is often treated as a black box.

This post documents how LX5 Aegis was built to understand how
integrity monitoring works internally.

The project uses:
• cryptographic SHA-256 baselines
• real-time filesystem events
• systemd integration

The focus is on design decisions, security trade-offs, and
lessons learned from building a defensive security tool from
first principles.
